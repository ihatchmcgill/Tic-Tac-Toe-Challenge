# Tic-Tac-Toe-Challenge

//Aug 19th
Here is my submission for my tic tac toe challenge. I coded it in C++ using Replit as my IDE. This took me about 3 hours to complete. I created some notes on paper but it was mainly just pictures of a tic tac toe board as I worked through the scenarios in my head of how to check for a winner.

Also just another thing I noticed. I forgot to add a default return statment in my checkDiag function to check for a diagnal winner. This means it was returning true sometimes when it shouldn't have been. I don't notice this in my inital testing as it wasn't super common. This is a really easy fix though, just need to add that return false statement after the second while loop.
